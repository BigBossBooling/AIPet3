Security Policy: Safeguarding CritterCraft's Digital Universe
Welcome, fellow digital pioneers and security researchers. As Josephis K. Wade, The Architect of CritterCraft and CEO of InfiniTec LLC, the integrity and resilience of our blockchain ecosystem are paramount. We are building a vibrant universe of AI pets forged on the blockchain, and ensuring its security is a non-negotiable bedrock.

This document defines how you, our community of users, developers, and security professionals, should responsibly report security vulnerabilities you discover within the CritterCraft repository. Your vigilance is a critical part of our defense. We adhere to "Sense the Landscape, Secure the Solution" in every aspect of our development, and that includes proactive vulnerability management.

How to Report a Security Vulnerability
We deeply appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. Please follow these steps to help us "Secure the Solution" for the entire CritterCraft community:

Discover with Purpose: If you believe you've found a security vulnerability within the CritterCraft codebase (including our core blockchain node, pallets, conceptual smart contracts, or UI components).

Contact Us Securely (Preferred Method):

IMMEDIATELY and PRIVATELY report the vulnerability via email to: security@infinitiecllc.com (Conceptual email address, reflecting Josephis's company).
DO NOT open a public GitHub issue, discuss on public forums, or disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved. This ensures the safety of our users and network.
Provide Comprehensive Details: To help us "Know Your Core, Keep it Clear" and efficiently verify and address the issue, please include as much detail as possible in your report:

Description: A clear, concise description of the vulnerability.
Affected Components: Specify the files, pallets, modules, or features impacted (e.g., pallet-critter-nfts, blockchain_core/ui-wallet/).
Steps to Reproduce: Detailed, step-by-step instructions that allow us to replicate the vulnerability.
Impact: Explain the potential consequences of the vulnerability (e.g., data loss, unauthorized access, denial of service).
Proof of Concept (Optional but Helpful): Any code, screenshots, or videos that demonstrate the vulnerability.
Proposed Fix (Optional): If you have a suggestion for a fix, please include it.
Our Commitment to Responsible Disclosure
When you report a vulnerability to us, you can expect:

Prompt Acknowledgment: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 2 business days.
Thorough Investigation: Our security team will swiftly investigate the reported vulnerability.
Regular Updates: We will keep you informed of our progress in addressing the issue.
Public Disclosure: Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will coordinate with you on public disclosure, if applicable, to ensure a responsible and timely announcement. We believe in transparency without compromising security.
Recognition: We will publicly credit you for your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
We kindly request that security researchers:

Do not engage in destructive testing (e.g., DDoS attacks, data destruction).
Do not access or modify user data without explicit permission.
Do not disclose vulnerability information publicly until we have confirmed a fix and agreed on a disclosure timeline.

This policy applies to security vulnerabilities found in:

The core CritterCraft blockchain node.
All official Substrate pallets within this repository.
Conceptual smart contracts (if applicable).
The UI Wallet and any other official frontend components.
Associated documentation directly linked within this repository.
Out of Scope
The following are generally not considered security vulnerabilities for the purpose of this policy:

Social engineering attacks.
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that do not exploit a specific code vulnerability.
Issues related to third-party services not directly controlled by CritterCraft.
