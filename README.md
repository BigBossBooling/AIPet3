# CritterCraft: An AI Pet Universe Forged on the Blockchain

Welcome to the CritterCraft project! This repository contains the conceptual design, strategic planning documents, and UI mockups for a unique AI Giga Pet / Tamagotchi-style application built on a custom Substrate-based blockchain (CritterChain).

## Project Vision

CritterCraft aims to create a universe where digital companions are intelligent beings with unique personalities, moods, and growth journeys. Their existence, attributes, and achievements are immutably recorded on a decentralized ledger. Players cultivate these AI pets, guide their development, engage them in competitive Pok√©mon-esque battles, send them on Neopets-style quests, and participate in a rich, player-driven economy.

The ecosystem is designed to allow users to earn real value through various activities including starting shops, taking on blockchain support jobs, participating in network consensus (PoS/DPoS), voting on the network's future, engaging in competitive gameplay, and much more, all underpinned by blockchain technology.

## Project Documentation Structure

This repository serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the CritterCraft project. The key design, strategy, and conceptual documents are organized as follows:

*   **Core Design & Feature Outlines:**
    *   [**Advanced Features & Gameplay Loops (`ADVANCED_FEATURES.md`)**](./ADVANCED_FEATURES.md): Details on future gameplay mechanics like Pet Breeding, Pet Day Cares, User Shops, Advanced Jobs, Treasure Hunts, and Mini-Games, including their conceptual UI designs.
    *   [**Architectural Principles (`ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md`)**](./ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md): Outlines the core philosophies guiding the development and evolution of CritterCraft's architecture, emphasizing modularity, security, and adaptability.

*   **Blockchain Architecture & Technical Strategy:**
    *   [**Consensus Migration Plan (PoA to PoS/DPoS) (`CONSENSUS_MIGRATION.md`)**](./CONSENSUS_MIGRATION.md): Details the plan and technical "recipe" for transitioning CritterChain to a Nominated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, including pallet configurations and genesis setup.
    *   [**Scalability Plan (`SCALABILITY_PLAN.md`)**](./SCALABILITY_PLAN.md): Outlines strategies for long-term scalability, primarily focusing on becoming a Polkadot/Kusama parachain.
    *   [**Interoperability Plan (`INTEROPERABILITY.md`)**](./INTEROPERABILITY.md): Describes plans for cross-chain compatibility, including XCM for the Polkadot ecosystem and bridging to external chains like Ethereum.

*   **Ecosystem Governance & Operations:**
    *   [**Governance Model (`GOVERNANCE.md`)**](./GOVERNANCE.md): Outlines the conceptual framework for decentralized governance of CritterCraft, including the roles of PTCN, `pallet-democracy`, `pallet-collective`, and `pallet-treasury`, along with conceptual UI flows.
    *   [**Security & Auditing Plan (`SECURITY_PLAN.md`)**](./SECURITY_PLAN.md): Details the comprehensive security strategy, covering code audits, bug bounty programs, incident response, treasury security, and key management.
    *   [**Community & Launch Strategy (`LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md`)**](./LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md): Provides a high-level strategy for community building, token distribution (conceptual), a phased mainnet launch, and post-launch marketing.

*   **Conceptual UI Prototype:**
    *   [**UI Wallet Mockup (`blockchain_core/ui-wallet/index.html`)**](./blockchain_core/ui-wallet/index.html): An HTML file containing static mockups and placeholders for the CritterCraft UI wallet, demonstrating conceptual user flows for most features. *(Note: This is a conceptual prototype, not a functional application).*

*   **Pallet Code (Conceptual Outlines):**
    *   The `blockchain_core/pallets/` directory contains conceptual Substrate pallet code (`lib.rs` outlines) for:
        *   `pallet-critter-nfts` (Core Pet NFT logic)
        *   `pallet-marketplace` (NFT buying/selling)
        *   `pallet-battles` (Pet battle registration & outcome reporting)
        *   `pallet-quests` (Quest management & completion)
        *   `pallet-breeding` (Conceptual outline for pet breeding)

## Current Status

This project is currently in the **advanced conceptual design and strategic planning phase**. The documents and UI mockups represent a detailed blueprint for future development. No live network or fully implemented pallets exist based solely on this repository's current state.

## Navigating the Project

*   Start with this `README.md` to understand the document structure.
*   Explore the linked markdown files for detailed information on specific aspects of the project.
*   Review the conceptual pallet outlines in the `blockchain_core/pallets/` directory.
*   View the `blockchain_core/ui-wallet/index.html` file in a web browser to see the conceptual UI placeholders.

We believe this comprehensive plan lays a strong foundation for building the exciting world of CritterCraft!
