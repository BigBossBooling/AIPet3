# CritterCraft Marketplace and Community Content Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented two key pallets to enhance the CritterCraft Universe:

1. **Enhanced Marketplace Pallet**: A comprehensive trading system with support for fixed-price listings, auctions, and escrow transactions.
