//! Weights for pallet-battles
//!
//! This file contains the `WeightInfo` trait and its default implementation.
//! These weights are crucial for accurately pricing transaction fees and
//! preventing denial-of-service attacks by consuming network resources.
//!
//! **IMPORTANT:** All weights in the default implementation are placeholder values.
//! For a production-ready CritterChain, these values MUST be replaced by
//! actual results generated from running FRAME benchmarking against the pallet.
//!
//! The `SubstrateWeights` struct provides an illustrative implementation that
//! conceptually accounts for dynamic parameters like battle complexity or
//! data transfer based on `RocksDbWeight` and execution time.
//!
//! Meticulously crafted to align with The Architect's vision for
//! economic integrity, scalability, and robust resource management in the CritterCraft digital ecosystem.
