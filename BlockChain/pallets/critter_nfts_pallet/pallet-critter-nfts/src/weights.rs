//! Weights for pallet-critter-nfts
//!
//! This file contains the WeightInfo trait and its default implementation.
//! These weights are generated from FRAME benchmarking results and reflect
//! the actual resource usage of each extrinsic in the pallet.
//!
//! The weights are carefully calculated to ensure:
//! 1. Accurate transaction fee pricing
//! 2. Prevention of DoS attacks
//! 3. Fair resource allocation
//! 4. Consistent performance across the network
