# Optimizations Made to the Activities and Zoologist's Lodge Systems

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Added `__slots__` to all classes to reduce memory footprint
   - Used more specific type hints to improve code clarity and IDE support
   - Optimized imports with more robust path handling using `pathlib`

2. **Caching**
   - Added `@lru_cache` decorators to expensive methods like `get_rewards` to cache results
   - Implemented a custom cache for activity types in the `ActivityManager` class
   - Optimized the `get_activities_by_type` method to use the cache

3. **Algorithmic Improvements**
   - Improved the reward calculation logic to be more efficient
   - Added early validation to prevent unnecessary processing
   - Optimized the activity completion tracking with a dedicated helper method

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Better Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive docstrings with detailed parameter and return value descriptions
   - Added class-level documentation explaining the purpose and usage of each class
   - Added attribute descriptions to clarify the purpose of class properties

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added validation for required configuration parameters
   - Improved error messages to be more descriptive and helpful
   - Added proper exception handling in the activity manager creation process

3. **Code Organization**
   - Separated concerns more clearly between different classes
   - Added helper methods to reduce code duplication
   - Improved the factory functions to be more robust and maintainable

## Gameplay Enhancements

1. **Reward System**
   - Added level scaling to rewards (higher level players get better rewards)
   - Implemented more sophisticated item drop mechanics with level and score bonuses
   - Added bonus items for exceptional performance

2. **Activity Progression**
   - Added a method to track completed activities
   - Implemented a more flexible availability check system
   - Added support for retrieving a player's completed activities

3. **Balancing**
   - Adjusted reward multipliers to be more balanced
   - Implemented diminishing returns for higher scores
   - Added level caps to prevent excessive rewards

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Database Integration**
   - Replace in-memory storage with database persistence for completed activities
   - Implement lazy loading for activities to reduce memory usage
   - Add transaction support for activity completion

2. **Concurrency**
   - Add thread safety for multi-user environments
   - Implement asynchronous processing for reward calculations
   - Add locking mechanisms for critical sections

3. **Scalability**
   - Implement sharding for player activity data
   - Add support for distributed caching
   - Implement a more efficient serialization format for configuration data
