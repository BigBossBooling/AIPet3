## Implementation Details

### Community Content System

The community content system is implemented in `pallet-community-content` with the following key components:

1. **Content Submission**:
   - Users submit content with metadata, a content URI (typically pointing to IPFS), and a content hash for verification
   - A deposit is required to prevent spam submissions
   - Content starts in a "Pending" status awaiting moderation

2. **Content Moderation**:
   - Designated moderators review submitted content
   - Content can be approved, rejected, or flagged for further review
   - Approved content becomes available in the marketplace
   - Rejected content results in the deposit being slashed

3. **Royalty Management**:
   - Creators set a royalty percentage (up to a configurable maximum)
   - When content is purchased or used, royalties are automatically paid to the creator
   - The `ContentRoyaltyManager` trait provides an interface for the marketplace to handle royalty payments

### Enhanced Marketplace

The marketplace system is implemented in `pallet-marketplace` with the following key components:

1. **Asset Management**:
   - The `AssetType` enum supports different types of tradable assets (Pets, Items, Content)
   - Integration with the NFT system for pets, the item system for items, and the community content system for user-created content

2. **Listing System**:
   - Support for both fixed-price listings and auctions
   - Fixed-price listings can have optional expiry times
   - Auction listings have configurable durations and minimum bid increments

3. **Trading Mechanisms**:
   - Direct purchase for fixed-price listings
   - Bidding system for auctions with automatic winner determination
   - Escrow system for secure peer-to-peer trading

4. **Fee Collection**:
   - Configurable fixed fee component
   - Configurable percentage fee component
   - Fees are sent to a designated treasury account

5. **Market Analytics**:
   - Track total trading volume
   - Count total transactions
   - Monitor fee collection

## Usage Examples

### Creating and Selling Community Content

1. A user creates a custom skin for their critter
2. They submit it to the community content system using `submit_content`
3. A moderator approves the content using `moderate_content`
4. The creator lists their content for sale using `list_content_fixed_price`
5. Another user purchases the content using `buy_fixed_price`
6. The creator receives payment minus marketplace fees
7. When the content is used in-game, the creator continues to receive royalties

### Trading Items via Auction

1. A user lists a rare item for auction using `list_items_auction`
2. Other users place bids using `place_bid`
3. When the auction ends, the highest bidder automatically wins
4. The item is transferred to the winner, and the seller receives payment minus fees

### Secure Trading with Escrow

1. A buyer initiates an escrow transaction with `create_escrow`
2. The buyer's funds are reserved but not yet transferred
3. The seller confirms the transaction with `confirm_escrow`
4. Once both parties confirm, the transaction completes automatically
5. If there's a dispute, either party can cancel the escrow before confirmation

## Configuration

Both pallets are highly configurable through their respective `Config` traits:

2. **Item System**: The marketplace uses the `ItemManager` trait to interact with the item system
3. **Currency System**: Both pallets use the substrate `Currency` trait for handling payments and deposits
