# CritterCraft: An AI Pet Universe Forged on the Blockchain

Welcome to the CritterCraft project! This repository contains the conceptual design, strategic planning documents, and UI mockups for a unique AI Giga Pet / Tamagotchi-style application built on a custom Substrate-based blockchain (CritterChain).

## Project Vision

CritterCraft aims to create a universe where digital companions are intelligent beings with unique personalities, moods, and growth journeys. Their existence, attributes, and achievements are immutably recorded on a decentralized ledger. Players cultivate these AI pets, guide their development, engage them in competitive Pok√©mon-esque battles, send them on Neopets-style quests, and participate in a rich, player-driven economy.

The ecosystem is designed to allow users to earn real value through various activities including starting shops, taking on blockchain support jobs, participating in network consensus (PoS/DPoS), voting on the network's future, engaging in competitive gameplay, and much more, all underpinned by blockchain technology.

## Project Documentation Structure

This repository serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the CritterCraft project. The key design, strategy, and conceptual documents are organized as follows:

*   **Foundational Concepts & Overviews:**
    *   [**Architectural Principles (`ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md`)**](./ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md): Outlines the core philosophies guiding the development and evolution of CritterCraft's architecture.
    *   [**Advanced Features & Gameplay Loops (`ADVANCED_FEATURES.md`)**](./ADVANCED_FEATURES.md): Details current and future gameplay mechanics like Pet Breeding, Day Cares, User Shops, Advanced Jobs, Treasure Hunts, Mini-Games, Pet Development, Item Systems, and User Reputation.
    *   [**Cross-System Synergies (`CROSS_SYSTEM_SYNERGIES.md`)**](./CROSS_SYSTEM_SYNERGIES.md): Explores the advantageous interactions and dependencies between different pallets and systems within CritterCraft to create emergent gameplay and economic depth.

*   **Blockchain Architecture & Technical Strategy:**
    *   [**Consensus Migration Plan (PoA to PoS/DPoS) (`CONSENSUS_MIGRATION.md`)**](./CONSENSUS_MIGRATION.md): Details the plan and technical "recipe" for transitioning CritterChain to a Nominated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.
    *   [**Node & Runtime Setup Details (`NODE_RUNTIME_SETUP_DETAILS.md`)**](./NODE_RUNTIME_SETUP_DETAILS.md): Provides conceptual `Cargo.toml` outlines for the node and runtime, and specific parameter examples for `pallet-staking`.
    *   [**Runtime Integration for Project 2 Pallets (`RUNTIME_PROJECT2_INTEGRATION.md`)**](./RUNTIME_PROJECT2_INTEGRATION.md): Documents the conceptual runtime integration steps for core gameplay pallets like `critter-nfts`, `marketplace`, `battles`, and `quests`.
    *   [**Scalability Plan (`SCALABILITY_PLAN.md`)**](./SCALABILITY_PLAN.md): Outlines strategies for long-term scalability, primarily focusing on becoming a Polkadot/Kusama parachain.
    *   [**Interoperability Plan (`INTEROPERABILITY.md`)**](./INTEROPERABILITY.md): Describes plans for cross-chain compatibility, including XCM for the Polkadot ecosystem and bridging to external chains.

*   **Ecosystem Operations & Governance:**
    *   [**Governance Model (`GOVERNANCE.md`)**](./GOVERNANCE.md): Outlines the conceptual framework for decentralized governance of CritterCraft.
    *   [**Security & Auditing Plan (`SECURITY_PLAN.md`)**](./SECURITY_PLAN.md): Details the comprehensive security strategy for the platform.
    *   [**Community & Launch Strategy (`LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md`)**](./LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md): Provides a high-level strategy for community building, token distribution, and mainnet launch.

*   **UI/Interaction Design & Specifications:**
    *   [**UI Wallet Mockup (`blockchain_core/ui-wallet/index.html`)**](./blockchain_core/ui-wallet/index.html): An HTML file with static mockups for the CritterCraft UI wallet, demonstrating conceptual user flows. *(Note: Conceptual prototype, not functional).*
    *   [**CLI Wallet Specification (`CLI_WALLET_SPEC.md`)**](./CLI_WALLET_SPEC.md): Details the commands, arguments, and expected outputs for a conceptual command-line interface wallet for interacting with CritterChain.
    *   [**UI Interactions for Core Gameplay (Project 2) (`UI_INTERACTIONS_PROJECT2.md`)**](./UI_INTERACTIONS_PROJECT2.md): Conceptual JavaScript logic for UI interactions with core gameplay pallets (`critter-nfts`, `marketplace`, `battles`, `quests`).
    *   [**UI Interactions for Advanced Features (`UI_INTERACTIONS_ADVANCED.md`)**](./UI_INTERACTIONS_ADVANCED.md): Conceptual JavaScript logic for UI interactions with advanced features like Breeding, Day Cares, and User Shops.

*   **Pallet Code (Conceptual Outlines):**
    *   The `blockchain_core/pallets/` directory contains conceptual Substrate pallet code (`lib.rs` outlines) for:
        *   `pallet-critter-nfts` (Core Pet NFT logic)
        *   `pallet-marketplace` (NFT buying/selling)
        *   `pallet-battles` (Pet battle registration & outcome reporting)
        *   `pallet-quests` (Quest management & completion)
        *   `pallet-breeding` (Conceptual outline for pet breeding)
        *   `pallet-items` (Conceptual outline for item management)
        *   `pallet-user-profile` (Conceptual outline for user scores and reputation)
        *   *(Conceptual outlines for pallet-daycare and pallet-user-shops are primarily detailed within ADVANCED_FEATURES.md as their dedicated lib.rs files were not created in this conceptual phase).*

## Current Status

This project is currently in the **advanced conceptual design and strategic planning phase**. The documents and UI mockups represent a detailed blueprint for future development. No live network or fully implemented pallets exist based solely on this repository's current state.

## Navigating the Project

*   Start with this `README.md` to understand the document structure.
*   Explore the linked markdown files for detailed information on specific aspects of the project.
*   Review the conceptual pallet outlines in the `blockchain_core/pallets/` directory.
*   View the `blockchain_core/ui-wallet/index.html` file in a web browser to see the conceptual UI placeholders.

We believe this comprehensive plan lays a strong foundation for building the exciting world of CritterCraft!
