# CritterCraft Security & Auditing Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive security strategy for the CritterCraft ecosystem, covering code audits, bug bounty programs, incident response, treasury management, key management, and ongoing secure development practices. The security of our users' assets and the integrity of the CritterChain are paramount.

## 1. Code Audits

Ensuring the robustness and security of our Substrate pallets and overall runtime is critical.

*   **Internal Code Reviews:**
    *   All new pallet development and significant modifications to existing pallets will undergo rigorous internal peer reviews by multiple developers.
    *   Focus areas: logic errors, access control vulnerabilities, economic exploits, reentrancy attacks (though less common in Substrate's model if not using cross-contract calls carelessly), and adherence to Substrate best practices.
    *   A pre-flight checklist for common vulnerabilities will be used before merging major features.
*   **External Code Audits:**
    *   Prior to mainnet launch, and before major upgrades involving significant new functionality (especially those handling user funds or core consensus), CritterChain's runtime and key pallets (e.g., `pallet-critter-nfts`, `pallet-marketplace`, `pallet-staking`, custom governance/treasury pallets) will be submitted for audit by reputable third-party security firms specializing in Substrate and blockchain security.
    *   Audit reports and any remediations will be made public to the community for transparency.
    *   A schedule for periodic re-audits of critical components will be established.

## 2. Bug Bounty Program

To incentivize community participation in identifying security vulnerabilities:

*   **Scope:** A clearly defined scope for the bug bounty program will be published, covering specific pallets, contracts (if any in the future), and aspects of the CritterChain node and UI wallet.
*   **Severity Levels:** Vulnerabilities will be classified by severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) with corresponding reward tiers.
*   **Reporting Mechanism:** A secure and confidential channel for researchers to report vulnerabilities will be established (e.g., a dedicated security email address or platform like Immunefi).
*   **Rewards:** Rewards will be paid in PTCN or a stablecoin, scaled according to the severity and impact of the discovered vulnerability.
*   **Disclosure Policy:** A responsible disclosure policy will be followed, ensuring vulnerabilities are fixed before public disclosure.

## 3. Incident Response Plan (IRP)

A plan will be developed to address security incidents effectively and minimize potential damage.

*   **Core Response Team:** A designated team responsible for coordinating the response to security incidents.
*   **Communication Channels:** Secure internal communication channels for the response team and predefined external communication protocols for informing the community and stakeholders.
*   **Incident Triage & Assessment:** Process for quickly assessing the severity and impact of a reported incident.
*   **Containment & Eradication:** Steps to contain the incident (e.g., pausing specific pallet functions, emergency council actions) and eradicate the vulnerability.
*   **Recovery:** Procedures for restoring normal operations and, if necessary, addressing any user losses (though prevention is the primary goal).
*   **Post-Mortem Analysis:** After any significant incident, a thorough post-mortem will be conducted to identify root causes and improve security measures and the IRP itself. This report will be shared with the community.

## 4. Treasury Management Security

If/when an on-chain treasury is implemented and holds significant funds:

*   **Multi-Signature Wallets:** The treasury account will be controlled by a multi-signature (multi-sig) scheme, requiring signatures from multiple trusted, geographically distributed key holders (e.g., core team members, elected community representatives).
*   **Spending Proposal Governance:** All treasury spending will be subject to the on-chain governance process (e.g., approval by the Council via `pallet-collective` and/or public referenda via `pallet-democracy`).
*   **Regular Reconciliation:** Regular checks and balances for treasury funds.

## 5. Key Management Best Practices

*   **Validators:**
    *   Strong recommendations and guides for validators on secure key management for their stash, controller, and session keys (e.g., using hardware wallets for stash/controller, secure generation and storage of session keys, regular key rotation where applicable).
    *   Discouraging the use of the same keys for multiple roles or across different networks.
*   **Users:**
    *   Educate users on best practices for securing their PTCN and Pet NFT wallet keys (e.g., using reputable wallet software, hardware wallets, strong passwords, avoiding phishing scams).
    *   Emphasize that users control their own keys and are responsible for their security in a decentralized environment.

## 6. Ongoing Secure Development Practices

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Pallets and extrinsics should only have the permissions necessary for their intended functionality.
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation of all inputs to extrinsics and public functions.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies and monitor for known vulnerabilities in upstream libraries or Substrate itself.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, including tests for security-related edge cases and economic attack vectors.
*   **Security Mindset:** Cultivate a security-first mindset within the development team through regular training and discussions.
*   **Stay Updated:** Keep abreast of emerging security threats and best practices in the Substrate and broader blockchain ecosystem.

This security plan is a living document and will be reviewed and updated regularly as the CritterCraft ecosystem evolves.
