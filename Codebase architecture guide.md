CritterCraft Universe - Codebase Architecture Guide
Welcome to CritterCraft Universe! This is a comprehensive architecture overview to help you understand this AI-powered blockchain pet simulation platform. Let me walk you through the key components and how they work together.

🏗️ High-Level Architecture Overview
CritterCraft is a multi-layered application that combines:

Frontend: React-based web interface with 3D graphics

Backend: Python-based pet simulation engine with AI integration

Blockchain: Custom Substrate-based blockchain (CritterChain) for NFTs and governance

AI Engine: Personality and behavior systems for digital companions

🎯 Core Components Deep Dive
1. Pet Simulation Engine (pet_core.py)
Purpose: The heart of the digital companion system

Key Classes:

Pet: Main pet entity with stats, personality, and behavior

InteractionRecord: Tracks all interactions for AI learning

Core Features:

Vital Stats: Hunger, happiness, energy (0-100 scale)

Personality Traits: AI-driven characteristics that evolve

Time-based Decay: Pets require care or stats decline

Interaction History: Persistent memory of all player actions

Data Flow:

Player Action → Pet.feed()/play() → Update Stats → AI Personality Analysis → Save State
2. Game Loop & Persistence (main.py)
Purpose: Main application entry point and user interface

Key Functions:

CLI-based interaction system

Local JSON persistence for pet state

Migration readiness assessment for blockchain

Time-based progression simulation

User Journey:

Start → Load/Create Pet → Main Menu → Actions (Feed/Play/Status) → Save State → Exit
3. Frontend Interface (frontend/)
Technology Stack:

React 18 with TypeScript

Vite for build tooling

Three.js for 3D pet visualization

Material UI for components

Polkadot.js for blockchain integration

Key Dependencies:

@polkadot/api: Blockchain connectivity

three: 3D graphics rendering

zustand: State management

react-query: Data fetching

4. Blockchain Layer (BlockChain/)
Architecture: Modular pallet-based design using Substrate framework

Core Pallets:

pallet-critter-nfts: Pet NFT management and ownership

pallet-marketplace: Trading and commerce

pallet-battles: Strategic combat system

pallet-breeding: Genetic breeding mechanics

pallet-items: Equipment and consumables

pallet-quests: Adventure and progression

Key Principles:

Modularity: Each pallet handles specific functionality

Trait-based Interfaces: Clean separation between components

Governance: Community-driven decision making

Security: Rigorous validation and audit processes

🔄 Data Flow & Interactions
Pet Lifecycle:
1. Creation → Generate unique DNA hash → Set base stats
2. Interaction → Update stats → Record history → AI analysis
3. Evolution → Personality changes → Blockchain migration readiness
4. Migration → Export to blockchain as NFT
Cross-System Communication:
Frontend ↔ API Layer ↔ Pet Engine ↔ Blockchain

  UI/UX    REST/WebSocket  Python     Substrate
🧠 AI Integration Strategy
Current State: Conceptual framework with placeholder traits

Future Vision:

LangChain integration for natural language processing

Personality evolution based on interaction patterns

AI-generated responses and behaviors

Machine learning for pet behavior prediction
