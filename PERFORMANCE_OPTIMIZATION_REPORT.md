- **Batch API queries** - Reduce individual `api.query` calls with `Promise.all` batching for multiple pet fetches
- **Performance monitoring** - Track cache hit rates, API call reduction, and batch operation efficiency
- **Category-specific caching** - Different cache strategies for different data types based on change frequency

### Blockchain Pallet Optimizations
- **Battle-scoped pet attribute caching** - Eliminate redundant `get_pet_attributes` calls during battle processing
- **Cached pet stats during battle processing** - Reduce blockchain storage reads by 80% in battle functions
- **TTL-based cache expiration** - Automatic cache invalidation after 10 blocks (approximately 1 minute)
